/**
A SessionProvider in the context of authentication libraries like NextAuth.js provides a way to manage and provide access to session-related data within your application. Here's what it does:

Manages Session State: The SessionProvider manages the state of the user's session. It keeps track of whether the user is authenticated or not, and if authenticated, it provides information about the current user's session, such as their user ID, email, and other relevant data.
Provides Session Data: The SessionProvider component wraps your application's components, allowing them to access session-related data. This includes hooks like useSession provided by NextAuth.js, which allows components to access information about the current session, such as the user's authentication status and user data.
Handles Authentication: The SessionProvider also handles the authentication process. It may handle tasks such as initializing the authentication flow, verifying user credentials, and managing authentication tokens. This ensures that your application's components have access to the necessary functionality to authenticate users securely.
Overall, the SessionProvider simplifies the process of managing user authentication and session data within your application, making it easier to build secure and user-friendly authentication experiences. */
